## Introduction

Eezy is a programming language designed to make **object-oriented programming concepts approachable**
while targeting the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** for practical execution.

The language is implemented in **Rust** and compiles source code into **Java bytecode**, allowing
programs written in Eezy to run on any standard JVM.

This page provides a brief overview of the project’s goals, technical foundations,
and recommended learning resources.

---

## Project Goals

Eezy is developed with a strong emphasis on **clarity and learning**.

The primary objectives of the project are:

- To present object-oriented programming concepts in a clear and structured manner
- To reduce unnecessary syntactic complexity without obscuring core ideas
- To expose learners to the fundamentals of programming language implementation
- To leverage the JVM as a stable and widely adopted execution platform
- To use Rust for building a reliable and maintainable compiler

Eezy is intended for students, educators, and developers who are interested in
both learning programming and understanding how programming languages are built.

## Quick Start

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Linux">
<Steps>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Download the eezy-compiler toolchain from the latest releases:
      <a href="https://github.com/vilayat-ali/eezy-lang/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        GitHub Releases
      </a>
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Install the eezy compiler on your system:</p>

    ```bash
    tar -xvzf ./ezc-VERSION.tarz
    mv eezy /etc/usr/eezy
    export ezc="/etc/usr/eezy/bin"
    ```
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Write a simple <code>hello.ez</code> program:</p>

    **NOTE**: Eezy-lang is in active development and syntax is subjected to change as per design decisions of the author*

    ```md
    @import std

    pub func main():
      std.out("Hello World")
    ```
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Run the program:</p>

    ```bash
    ezc run hello.ez
    ```
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Optional:</em> Build a Java class file artifact:
    </p>

    ```bash
    ezc build hello.ez
    ```

    <p>
      This will generate a <code>hello.class</code> file that can be executed on the JVM.
    </p>
  </li>

## Technology Overview

Eezy combines a modern compiler implementation with a well-established runtime.

### Compiler

- Implemented in **Rust**
- Focuses on safety, performance, and clear internal structure
- Designed to support incremental development of language features

### Runtime Target

- Targets the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**
- Compiles Eezy source code to **Java bytecode**
- Enables cross-platform execution without a custom runtime

### Documentation

- Built using **Astro**
- Uses the **Starlight** documentation framework
- Authored in Markdown and MDX

---

## Prerequisites

To work with Eezy, the following tools are required:

- A recent **Rust toolchain** for building the compiler
- A **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** to execute compiled programs
- A **Java Development Kit (JDK)** for JVM tooling and inspection

You can verify your setup with:

```bash
rustc --version
java --version
javac --version
```

## Further Reading

Understanding Eezy benefits from familiarity with Java, the JVM, and compiler design.
The following resources are recommended:

### Java and the JVM

* Oracle Java Tutorials
  [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)

* JVM Architecture Overview
  [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/)

* JVM Internals (Baeldung)

  This resource provides a clear and methodical introduction to language implementation
  and strongly aligns with Eezy’s educational philosophy.

## Next Steps

After reviewing this introduction, you may proceed to:

* The language overview and syntax reference
* Compiler architecture and implementation details
* Examples and experiments using the Eezy compiler

Please note that Eezy is under active development, and aspects of the language
and tooling may evolve over time.
