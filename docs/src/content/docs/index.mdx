## Why Eezy?

Eezy is a modern programming language designed to make **object-oriented programming approachable**
without sacrificing performance or real-world relevance.

It compiles directly to **Java bytecode**, so your programs run anywhere the JVM runs — while the compiler
itself is written in **Rust** for speed, safety, and correctness.

Whether you are a **beginner learning programming concepts** or a **developer exploring language design**,
Eezy focuses on clarity, simplicity, and strong foundations.

## What can you do with Eezy?

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Learn OOP the right way" icon="open-book">
		Eezy is designed as a teaching-first language that emphasizes clean abstractions,
		readable syntax, and core object-oriented principles.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Target the JVM" icon="puzzle">
		Compile Eezy programs to Java bytecode and run them on any platform
		that supports the Java Virtual Machine.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Modern compiler in Rust" icon="seti:rust">
		The Eezy compiler is written in Rust, providing strong safety guarantees,
		great performance, and a clean internal architecture.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Simple and expressive syntax" icon="approve-check-circle">
		Focus on solving problems instead of fighting syntax.
		Eezy removes unnecessary verbosity while keeping concepts explicit.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Explore language design" icon="open-book">
		Perfect for students and enthusiasts interested in how programming languages
		are built — from parsing to bytecode generation.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Open source & evolving" icon="github">
		Eezy is actively developed in the open.
		Contributions, discussions, and experiments are welcome.
	</Card>
