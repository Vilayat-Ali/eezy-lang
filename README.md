# Eezy 🚀

A modern programming language that compiles to Java bytecode, built with the power and safety of Rust. ⚡

## 📖 Overview

Eezy is a new programming language designed to target the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Written entirely in Rust 🦀, Eezy compiles source code to Java bytecode, allowing your programs to run seamlessly on any JVM while leveraging Rust's performance and safety features for the compiler itself.

## 🌟 Features

- **🎯 JVM Target**: Compiles directly to Java bytecode for cross-platform compatibility
- **🦀 Rust Implementation**: Fast, safe, and modern compiler architecture
- **💫 Simple Syntax**: Clean and expressive language design (details TBD)
- **⚡ Performance**: Leverages JVM optimizations with modern language features

## 🚧 Project Status

**Early Development** 🔬

Eezy is currently in active development. Language syntax, features, and implementation details are being finalized.
